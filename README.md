## Quick Creation of a Website

### HTML Boilerplate

Generated new website with [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate).

```
npx create-html5-boilerplate new-site
cd new-site
npm install
npm start
```

### Color Theme

1. Searched [Picular](https://picular.co) for a color related to _mint_. Decided on `#509413`.
2. Generated a color theme with [Eva Design System](https://colors.eva.design/). Downloaded the theme as `custom-theme.json`.

### Background Image

1. Searched [Duotone](https://duotone.shapefactory.co/) for an image related to _mint_, then colored it with `#509413` and `#ebf9ce`. The duo toned image was downloaded, and saved as `bg.png` (later exported and renamed to `bg.jpg`).
2. Followed instructions at [Perfect Full Page Background Image](https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/) to set `bg.png` as the background image.
